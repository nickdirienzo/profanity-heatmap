profanity-heatmap
=================

Utilizes [GitHub Archive](http://www.githubarchive.org/) to collect events hourly, and draws them on a heatmap. Powered by [Martini](http://martini.codegangsta.io/) and [mgo](http://labix.org/mgo).

Started at [Stripe's Sit Hack and Relax](https://stripe.com/blog/sit-hack-and-relax). My first real project in [Go](http://golang.org/), so don't judge me too hard.
